I'm a disciplined self-starter interested in working on challenging problems as a full stack software engineer. Currently, I am based out of the greater Boston, Massachusetts area.

Recently, I co-created [Arroyo](https://www.arroyoframework.com/case-study.html), a lightweight framework for the granular rehydration of logs.
